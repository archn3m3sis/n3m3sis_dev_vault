### Click Events & Redirects 
---

one way that we can allow users to navigate is by using an `on_click` event and then calling `rx.redirect` 

for example

```
rx.button("Hello", on_click=rx.redirect('/home'))
```

we could also perform the redirect using the `rx.State` like in the following example: 

```
class ClickState(rx.State)
```

this brings up a common challenge with programmatic redirects and any programmatic page navigation within an app (especially large scale applications)... The tendency to have errors where routes are supplied that don't exist is a common one.. 

on any given reflex application, we can comment out the original methodology for an application's page generation, and do the following: 

```
app.add_page(pages.home, route='/home')
```

then we would go into our actual page, and use an `rx.Decorator` of `@rx.page` and then supply the route directly to the page...

### Review Of Way To Route Pages

1. `rx.link` reflex native component...
	- `rx.link(rx.button("About Us"), href="/about")
	- benefits to this method are user experience in the production application and the fact that they will have the ability to copy the link that is shown when right clicking the component`
2. `on_click` events and `rx.redirect`...
