The easiest way to simplify programmatic details like page routing in a large scale application, is to use something called `url_redirect_constants`...

To do this you will need to create a `navigation` directory under your main app directory, and then create an additional `__init__.py` file and a file called `routes.py`...

```
#/cyber_industrial/routes.py

HOME_PATH="/"
LOGIN_PATH="/login"
SIGNUP_PATH="/signup"
LOGOUT_PATH="/logout"
LOG_COLLECTION_PATH="/logcollection"
DAT_FILE_UPDATE_PATH="/datfileupdate"
IMAGE_COLLECTION_PATH="/imagecollection"
DATABASE_MODS_PATH="/databasemods"
ANALYTICS_PATH="/analytics"
```
