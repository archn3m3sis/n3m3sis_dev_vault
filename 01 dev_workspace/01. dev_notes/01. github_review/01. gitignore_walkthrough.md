### The Files You Would Prefer NOT To Track
---
There are some files within the development that you should certainly never share to your github repository... These include any files that contain PII, Secrets, or other Sensitive or Proprietary Information you'd rather not share with 1000's of curious developers around the globe... 

#### Common Examples Of Files To Include With The Gitignore File 
---

| What To Ignore                         | The `.gitignore` Entry |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| A Single File                          | `secrets.txt`          |
| A Folder & It's Contents               | `secrets.txt`          |
| All Environment Files                  | `*.env`                |
| Everything In A Folder Except One Item | `!temp/keep.txt`       |

If Git has already tracked a file, adding it to `.gitignore` wonâ€™t remove it. You must untrack it first:

```
git rm --cached filename
```

Then you will need to commit the removal of the tracked file: 

```
git commit -m "Remove tracked .env and add to .gitignore
```

After this has processed you will need to add the .gitignore to the tracked files and commit the changes with: 

```
git add .gitignore
git commit -m "Add .gitignore to prevent syncing sensitive/dev files"
```

#### Universal No No Files To Exclude With The Gitignore
---
There are many items, which you may very well wish to exclude from all of your repositories, no matter what the project spec is. To do this you will need to first configure your universal file with the following:  

```
git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore_global
```

Then you will need to create the above mentioned ignore file: 

```
nano ~/.gitignore_global
```

Common entries often and should include items like:

```
.DS_Store
*.swp
*.pyc
.vscode/
```

The important consideration for all to make is that there is no one size fits all situation for a gitignore. This will depend on your development environment and the system configuration you have in place on the host that you are developing from...
